Other References
====================

This book can't possibly cover everything there is to know in two massive disciplines. Each author here has obtained their knowledge through other references and through experience. The latter is hard earned but we can easily share some of the former. 

## Heliophysics
* [The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1987142.The_Cambridge_Encyclopedia_of_the_Sun) by Kenneth R. Lang
    * Deeper than a coffee table book, but just as full of great visuals
    * An excellent overview of the basics -- turns out there is more to the sun than it being a yellow ball of distant fire
* [Journey from the Center of the Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1072448.Journey_from_the_Center_of_the_Sun) by Jack B. Zirker
    * A good start for pretty much anyone; a high school class on physics is sufficient but having taken some college classes in physics would prevent the need to look up some stuff
    * Covers the physics from the center of the sun to the sun's influence on the earth
* [The Sun, the Earth, and Near-Earth Space](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20110011535) by Jack Eddy
    * A well written book covering most of heliophysics and its place in astronomy without an overwhelming amount of technical detail
* [Severe Space Weather Events - Understanding Societal and Economic Impacts](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12507/severe-space-weather-events-understanding-societal-and-economic-impacts-a) by the National Research Council
    * A great reference for why heliophysics matters
* [The Solar Transition Region](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/physics/astrophysics/solar-transition-region?format=HB&isbn=9780521382618) by John T. Mariska
    * A deep dive into the physics of the transition region
    * A good reference for specialists in this field
* [Stellar Atmospheres](http://www.worldcat.org/title/stellar-atmospheres/oclc/109489) by Dimitri Mihalas
    * A deep dive into the physics of stellar atmospheres
    * Not for the faint of heart; can be a challenge even for helio PhDs but very valuable

## Machine Learning / Programming
* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) by Jacob T. VanderPlas
    * The final chapter is dedicated to machine learning with `scikit-learn`
    * Similar to HelioML, this book mainly focuses on learning by doing -- it has ample examples
    * The book is available in print but also is freely available on GitHub
* [Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10159.html) by Željko Ivezić, Andrew J. Connolly, Jacob T. VanderPlas & Alexander Gray
    * This book also has an [accompanying python module called AstroML](http://www.astroml.org)
    * Heliophysics can be be considered a specialized subset of astronomy, so many of the methods described in this book are relevant
* [Machine Learning online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Stanford professor Andrew Ng via Coursera
    * This course has you write code for the machine learning techniques themselves so you can gain a deep understanding
    * The course builds up from there to applications of the techniques
* [Clean Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/) by Robert C. Martin
    * Not heliophysics or machine learning or even python specific
    * But fills in the gap that most scientists have in best programming practices since most of us are self taught coders
    * Very well written with lots of example code to really demonstrate why one way is better than another
