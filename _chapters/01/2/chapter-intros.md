What You'll See in the Chapters to Come
====================

In this introductory chapter, we've barely scratched the surface of heliophysics and of machine learning. We specifically chose an example that would hopefully be a more familiar starting point for heliophysicists and for data scientists. In the following chapters, we'll dive a bit deeper into examples from real, active research being done, most of which has also been published in peer-review journals. The rabbit hole goes deeper, and we provide some other references in the next section.
