# HelioML

HelioML is a book about machine learning, statistics, and data mining for heliophysics.

The idea behind the book is to put together a collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks, written in Python, that explicitly shows the reader how to use machine learning techniques on various kinds of heliophysics data sets to reproduce published results. 

This book is built using markdown and Jupyter notebooks with a website that's based on Jekyll and has a Binder plugin. If you click on any chapter -- for example, Chapter 3-1 -- and then click on the "Interact" button on the top of the page, it will spin up an instance of [Binder](https://mybinder.org). A user can then run, or modify and execute, all the code in the chapter.

The format of this book is based on UC Berkeley's Data 8 course, which has a digital-only textbook called [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/), and built using a workflow developed by [Chris Holdgraf](https://predictablynoisy.com/textbooks-with-jupyter/chapters/introduction/intro).
