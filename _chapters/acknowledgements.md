# Acknowledgements

We built this book on a mountain of incredibly useful open-source tools. The source code for this book converts a collection of Jupyter notebooks ([Kluyver et al., 2016](http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/42900)) and markdown files into a static website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Readers can modify and execute code within this book by clicking on the "Interact" button at the top of each chapter (thanks to [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)).

Two other textbooks, both developed using open-source software, inspired this book. One is UC Berkeley's Data 8 course textbook, [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/), by Ani Adhikari and John DeNero. The other is [Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10159.html) by Željko Ivezić, Andrew J. Connolly, Jacob T. VanderPlas and Alexander Gray, which is a companion textbook to the [AstroML](http://www.astroml.org/) python package by [VanderPlas et al., 2012](http://www.astroml.org/index.html#citing-astroml).

This book was built using a workflow developed by [Chris Holdgraf](https://predictablynoisy.com/textbooks-with-jupyter/chapters/introduction/intro) with support from the Data Science Education Program and the Berkeley Institute for Data Science at UC Berkeley.

We'd like to thank Ani Adhikari, Chris Holdgraf, and Jacob VanderPlas, as well as Scott Bailey and Javier de la Rosa from the [Stanford University Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research](https://library.stanford.edu/research/cidr), Erik Tollerud from the [Space Telescope Science Institute](http://www.stsci.edu/) and [Astropy Project](http://www.astropy.org/), and Eric Jonas from the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley for their valuable conversation, guidance, and encouragement.
